In this project, there are the necessary codes for processing analog data by converting it to digital data and printing it on the LCD using Tiva. I made the ADC interrupt using ready-made api codes Some commands are written using ready-made libraries. So pay attention to the libraries defined at the beginning... // I use Code Composer Studio IDE.
