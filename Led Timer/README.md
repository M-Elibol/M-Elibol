In this project, I implemented the code that flashes the LED on Tiva once a second. Beware of ready-made libraries !!!
** I use Code Composer Studio IDE.

Important Note:  The function named "timekesmesi" is assigned as extern void in the file "tm4c123gh6pm_startup_ccs.c" and should be written next to "Timer 0 subtimer A".
